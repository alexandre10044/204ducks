# 204ducks
Epitech Project, MATHS 204

Subject:

When ducks are disturbed by a sudden noise, they fly away almost simultaneously, and everything is de-serted. Chances that a duck will then come back aftertminutes are given by the following probability den-sity function:
  f: [0,+∞[−→Rt7−→ae−t+
    (4−3a)e−2t+ (2a−4)e−4t
    
where a is a real constant between 0 and 2.5, which depends on external factors (such as temperature, daytime, duck’s health etc.).
  
A study is being conducted about these ducks, and you are asked to compute and display the following,given the value of a:
1. The average time after which ducks come back,
2. The standard deviation of the ducks’ return time,
3. The time after which 50% of all of the ducks are back,
4. The time after which 99% of all of the ducks are back,
5. The percentage of ducks that come back after 1 minute,
6. The percentage of ducks that come back after 2 minutes.

Usage:

./204ducks a

a is a constant
